## Challenges
this list grows as more parts of the applicataion are implemented.
  
|   **challenge** | **solution** |
|-------------|----------|
| create a slide effect for `Card` component. | use a absolute positioned container and transform it using `translate` and change in its height. |
| create a glitter effect for the border of `Card` component. | use a `conic-gradient` effect with a proper `animation`. use the `@property` for more ease. |
| find a scalable solution for handling themes. | use the `prefers-color-scheme` media feature. |
| UI design for small and large devices are not compatible. | use different UI designs for different view widths with different components. |
| writing components' boilerplates is boring. | write a python script to do it for you. |
